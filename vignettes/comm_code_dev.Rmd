Software is not immediately stable when being developed. It undergoes design changes, changes to the user interface (application programming interface, API), and features get added over time. Software in a open-source setting, in which the code is publicly hosted in a repository (e.g., Github, Gitlab, BitBucket) allows the public to track developments. It also allows the developer community to contribute to the software easily.  There are certain metrics which can be used to convey to users of a package or other developers at what stage of development it is in. For example the number of commits, a repository with few commits may indicate that a project is still in an incipient phase and will undergo several breaking changes. However, different software projects become stable at different rates and the number of commits may mean very different things for a repository containing an operating system compared to an R package with minimal functionality. It is therefore important that developers communicate with users and developers at what stage of develop the project is in and how stable the code base is. 

Software development, and specifically R package development, has several methods to communicate stability. This blog post will discuss two such methods and give examples for each. The first of these is versioning code, which establishes points in development where the code is ready for use; and the second is lifecycle badges, these can be placed at a different levels within software (e.g. package, function, function argument) to convey how a user should interact and use.

## Versioning

Versioning code is not a new concept and has been used for decades[^1]. It has lead to version control systems such as git. However, in this post we are interested in versioing to communicate development. One such philosophy is [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This aims to describe the stage of software development by attaching semantics (i.e. meaning) to the format and numbering of versions. The version system works through three numbers, each separated by a dot. The numbers, from left to right, convey major version, minor version and patch version. Therefore, 0.5.2, is greater than 0.3.9.

Employing semantic versioning in ones code development allows others to determine whether a package has undergone substantial development and testing, and informs to whether it would make a suitable package to use in script or as a dependency for another developing package. Semantic versioning also describes the change made to a package. As explained on [their website](https://semver.org/), incrementing the major version implies a breaking change, a minor increment is a backwards compatible change and lastly patches are mostly applied to bug fixes. This aids users in understanding whether they should continue using a package, whether their package needs updating due to a breaking change or whether they need to install the newest version because a bug was recently fixed. 

Overall sematic versioning provides what they describe as a "formal specification" to facilitate management of package development and the dependencies of that package.

Although not discussed in this post there are alternatives to  semantic versioning, such as calendar versioning[^2].

## Lifecycle badges

Badges can be pasted onto visible parts of the code, for example a readme document in the root of the repository, to clearly show users where the developer thinks the package is at in terms of development and stability. The three badging systems we will discuss in this post are: 

- [RepoStatus](https://www.repostatus.org/)
- [Tidyverse lifecycles](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/)
- [Reconverse lifecyles](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html)

### RepoStatus

RepoStatus is a language agnostic set of badges which describe the stages of code development and the possible transitions between those stages.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Reused under CC BY-SA 4.0"}
cat("![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jantman/repostatus.org/master/gh_pages/images/lifecycle.svg)\n")
```

### Tidyverse

The tidyverse approach is broadly the same as RepoStatus. In the {lifecycle} R package contains the description of their process. There are four stages: 

1. Experimental
2. Stable
3. Superseded (previously called retired)
4. Deprecated

Most code will go through the experimental phase, as it will likely change it's API and the number and order of arguments might change. Once code is not going to drastically change (i.e. no breaking changes), at least from a users point of view, it can be labelled stable. In the tidyverse lifecycle schematic, all experimental code transitions to stable code. The two stages that follow stable are: superseded and deprecated. The former describes a situation in which a new package, a new function or a new argument, depending on the context, has been developed which the developer feels should be used instead of the former, now superseded code. superseded code is still developed in the sence that changes to the language or package that may break the function will be fixed as well as bug fixes, but the function will not received ongoing development. The latter, deprecation, is used in cases when the developed think a someone using the code should not longer use that package or function. This is primarily employed when code is depended on by other software and therefore deleting the code would cause breaks in reverse dependencies. Thus the deprecation warning allows developers of those dependencies time to make the relevant changes. 
```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Reused under MIT license"}
cat("![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-lib/lifecycle/main/vignettes/figures/lifecycle.svg)\n")
```

One of the main differences between the tidyverse lifecycles, compared to the others discussed in this posts is their applicability at different levels in the code. The lifecycle badges can be applied at the package-level, the function-level or the argument level. Examples of this can be found throughout tidyverse code...

Using {lifecycle} in a package can be setup using:

```r
usethis::use_lifecycle()
```

The {lifecycle} package not only provides badges, but also informative deprecation notices which communicate to users that a function is not longer supported since a version release of a package. This offers the user a chance to find an alternative function for future use. 

```{r}
dep_func()
```

Most functions deprecated with {lifecycle} will return a warning, these are soft deprecations. Alternatively a function may become defunct, in which can the deprecation will produce an error.

```{r, error=TRUE}
hard_dep_func()
```

The use of deprecation warnings from {lifecycle} leads onto another aspect of tidyverse development: protracted deprecation. There is no fixed rules on how long after a deprecation warning is made to when code should be removed. In the tidyverse, this process is given ample time in order to allow the many developers that utilise tidyverse software to make the necessary changes. 

Full descriptions of the {lifecycle} package can be found on the [pkgdown site](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/index.html), including the deprecated use of questioning and maturing stages.

### Reconverse

Is similar to {lifecycle} reconverse provides four stages of software development:

1. concept
2. experimental
3. maturing
4. stable

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Reused under MIT license"}
cat("![](https://github.com/reconverse/reconverse.github.io/blob/master/images/lifecycle_no_text.png)\n")
```

A difference between {lifecycles} and reconverse is the explicit connection between semantic versioning and development stage in [reconverse](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). The transitions between experimental, maturing and stable are linked to the versioning less than 0.1.0, less than 1.0.0 and greater than 1.0.0, respectively.

### Communicating development in the Epiverse

Within the Epiverse initiative we use semantic versioning and badges to convey to the community interacting with our code at which stage of developement each project is in. We do not have fixed rules on which badges to use and a variety of badges can be found across the repositories in the [organisation](https://github.com/epiverse-trace). For example reconverse badges are used for {linelist}, RepoStatus badge is used in {finalsize}, and tidyverse badges are used in {epiparameter}. We take this approach as no lifecycle badging system is perfect, each with benefits and downsides. The badges from {lifecycle} are the most common and thus recognisable in R package development, however may not port well to other languages or be familiar to developers coming to R from other frameworks. RepoStatus has the benefit of not being designed for a single language, and it's number of badges gives greater acuity to the stage of development for a project. This may be especially useful if a package is newly developed and {lifecycle} would describe it as experimental, but RepoStatus provides granualirty as to whether it is a concept package, work in progress (WIP) or started but abandoned. Lastly reconverse provides a system akin to {lifecycle} and may be useful for those working in the epidemiology developer space. However, one downside of the reconverse system is there are no clear semantics for a package being deprecated or archived. As with almost all code, at some point development ceases and this stage should be communicated, even if just to say that the package is not being updated inline with developments in the underlying language, in this case R.

Overall, the use of any of the three lifecycle frameworks described here is better than none.
