# This script is used to test the functionality of packages that work with
# semantic versioning.

# The two packages used in this script are {semver} and {semverutils}. Both of
# these packages are dependencies of {lifecycling} and are available from CRAN

# This script is not a vignette as the {lifecycling} package is not aimed to
# showcase the functionality of these packages, and this script is aimed at
# understanding what these packages offer
