<p>Software is not immediately stable when being developed. It undergoes
design changes, changes to the user interface (application programming
interface, API), and features get added or removed over time. Software
in a open-source setting, in which the code is publicly hosted in a
repository (e.g., Github, GitLab, Bitbucket), allows anyone to track
developments. It also allows the developer community to easily
contribute to the software.</p>
<p>There are certain metrics which can be used to convey the stage of
development to users or other developers. For example the number of
commits, a repository with few commits may indicate that a project is
still in an incipient phase and will undergo several breaking changes.
However, different software projects become stable at different rates
and the number of commits may mean very different things for a
repository containing an operating system compared to an R package with
minimal functionality. It is therefore important that developers
communicate with users and other developers at what stage the project is
in, and how stable the code base is.</p>
<p>Software development, and specifically R package development, has
several methods to communicate stability. This blog post will discuss
two such methods and give examples for each. The first of these is
versioning code, which establishes points in development where the code
is ready for use; and the second is lifecycle badges, these can be
placed at a different levels within software (e.g., package, function,
function argument) to convey how a user should interact and use.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="versioning">Versioning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#versioning"></a>
</h2>
<p>Versioning code is not a new concept and has been used for decades<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" class="external-link uri"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a>. It has
led to version control systems such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="external-link">git</a>. However, in this post we are
interested in versioning to communicate development.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic versioning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#semantic-versioning"></a>
</h3>
<p>One such philosophy is <a href="https://semver.org/" class="external-link">semantic
versioning</a> (SemVer). This aims to describe the stage of software
development by attaching semantics (i.e. meaning) to the format and
numbering of versions. The version system works through three numbers,
each separated by a dot. The numbers, from left to right, convey major
version, minor version and patch version. As an example, 0.5.2, is newer
than 0.3.9.</p>
<p>Employing semantic versioning in ones code development allows others
to determine whether a package has undergone substantial development and
testing, and informs to whether it would make a suitable package to use
in a script or as a dependency for another package. Semantic versioning
also describes the changes made to a package. As explained on <a href="https://semver.org/" class="external-link">their website</a>, incrementing the major
version implies a breaking change, a minor increment is a backwards
compatible change and lastly patches are mostly applied to bug fixes.
This aids users in understanding whether they should continue using a
package, whether their package needs updating due to a breaking change
or whether they need to install the newest version because a bug was
recently fixed.</p>
<p>In R there are several packages that work with versioning, and
specifically semantic versioning. The {semver} package provides
functions for parsing, rendering and comparing versions. There is also
the {semverutils} R package which provides similar functionality using
<code>R6</code>. The {usethis} package provides handy utility functions
for changing the versions of R packages
(<code>usethis::use_version()</code> and
<code>usethis::use_dev_version()</code>). R also comes with a
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric_version.html" class="external-link">package_version()</a></code> function for creating and validating
versions.</p>
<p>Overall sematic versioning provides what they describe as a “formal
specification” to facilitate management of package development and the
dependencies of that package. It is the most widely-used versioning
system and therefore will be understood by a wide variety of users and
developers.</p>
<p>Some of the critique raised for semantic versioning is the difficulty
of defining how changes correspond to a version increment. Semantic
versioning states only breaking changes warrant major releases, but a
vast re-write of a code base may also justify a major version change.
Different breaking changes have different magnitudes, therefore a change
to a single exported function or a change to every exported function
will be communicated in a single, equal, version increment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="alternatives-to-seminatic-versioning">Alternatives to seminatic versioning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#alternatives-to-seminatic-versioning"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are several other versioning frameworks aside from semantic
versioning. One common option is <a href="https://calver.org/" class="external-link">calendar
versioning</a> (or CalVer). The format of CalVer is usually year-month
(YY-MM), or year-month-day (YY-MM-DD), depending on the regularity of
releases, and allows appending tags (micros or modifiers,
e.g. YY-MM.1).</p>
<p>Other versioning schemes can appear similar to semantic versioning,
but do not follow the guidelines around version semantics. In these
cases, a bump in the major version may not relate to breaking changes.
Additionally, other numbers can be attached to the traditional x.y.z
format, such as build numbers. Build number versioning adds an extra
number to specify the build (x.y.z.build_number). There are many other
variants but covering all versioning systems is outside the scope of
this post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="versioning-an-r-package">Versioning an R package<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#versioning-an-r-package"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are some restrictions on what version numbers can be for R
packages. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html" class="external-link">guidelines
state</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a sequence of at least two (and usually three) non-negative
integers separated by single ‘.’ or ‘-’ characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-version">Why version?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-version"></a>
</h3>
<p>The benefits of versioning apply beyond communicating with users and
developers. Implementing versioning eases reproducibility by allowing
systems to record which version of a language or package was used. In R
this can be achieved in several ways, with some popular examples being
the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html" class="external-link">{renv}
package</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/" class="external-link">docker</a>.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="lifecycle-badges">Lifecycle badges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lifecycle-badges"></a>
</h2>
<p>Badges can be pasted onto visible parts of the code, for example a
readme document in the root of the repository, to show the development
phase and stability. The three badging systems we will discuss in this
post are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.repostatus.org/" class="external-link">RepoStatus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">Tidyverse lifecycles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html" class="external-link">Reconverse
lifecyles</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="repostatus">RepoStatus<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#repostatus"></a>
</h3>
<p>RepoStatus is a language agnostic set of badges which describe the
stages of code development and the possible transitions between those
stages.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure below, there are multiple stages to
communicate both unstable and stable software. There are also multiple
paths between each stage, recognising the varied routes software
development can take.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jantman/repostatus.org/master/gh_pages/images/lifecycle.svg"><em>Reused under CC BY-SA 4.0 from <a href="https://www.repostatus.org/" class="external-link">repostatus.org</a></em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="tidyverse">Tidyverse<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tidyverse"></a>
</h3>
<p>The tidyverse approach is broadly similar to RepoStatus. The
{lifecycle} R package contains the description of their process. There
are four stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experimental</li>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Superseded (previously called retired)</li>
<li>Deprecated</li>
</ol>
<p>Most code will go through the experimental phase, as it will likely
change it’s API and the number and order of arguments might change. Once
code is not going to drastically change (i.e. no breaking changes), at
least from a users point of view, it can be labelled stable. In the
tidyverse lifecycle schematic, all experimental code transitions to
stable code.</p>
<p>The two stages that follow stable are: superseded and deprecated. The
former describes a situation in which a new package, a new function or a
new argument, depending on the context, has been developed which the
developer feels should be used instead of the former, now superseded
code. superseded code is still developed in the sense that changes to
the language or package that may break the function will be fixed as
well as bug fixes, but the function will not received ongoing
development. The latter, deprecation, is used in cases when the
developed think a someone using the code should not longer use that
package or function. This is primarily employed when code is depended on
by other software and therefore deleting the code would cause breaks in
reverse dependencies. Thus the deprecation warning allows developers of
those dependencies time to make the relevant changes. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-lib/lifecycle/main/vignettes/figures/lifecycle.svg"><em>Reused under MIT license from <a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html" class="external-link">lifecycles R
package</a></em></p>
<p>One of the main differences between the tidyverse lifecycles,
compared to the others discussed in this posts is their applicability at
different levels in the code. The lifecycle badges can be applied at the
package-level (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr" class="external-link">stringr</a>, the
function-level (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/16b472fb2afc50a87502c2b4ed803e2f5f82b9d6/R/group-trim.R" class="external-link"><code>dplyr::group_trim()</code></a>)
or the argument level (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/16b472fb2afc50a87502c2b4ed803e2f5f82b9d6/R/across.R#L36" class="external-link"><code>dplyr::across()</code></a>).</p>
<p>Using {lifecycle} in a package can be setup using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_lifecycle</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The {lifecycle} package not only provides badges, but also
informative deprecation notices which communicate to users that a
function is not longer supported since a version release of a package.
This offers the user a chance to find an alternative function for future
use.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/dep_func.html">dep_func</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Warning: `dep_func()` was deprecated in lifecycling 0.1.0.</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #555555;">This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.</span></span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #555555;">Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was</span></span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #555555;">generated.</span></span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] "Deprecated function"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Most functions deprecated with {lifecycle} will return a warning,
these are soft deprecations. Alternatively a function may become
defunct, in which can the deprecation will produce an error.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/hard_dep_func.html">hard_dep_func</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #BBBB00; font-weight: bold;">Error</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span></span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #BBBB00;">!</span> `hard_dep_func()` was deprecated in lifecycling 0.1.0 and is now</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt;   defunct.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The use of deprecation warnings from {lifecycle} leads onto another
aspect of tidyverse development: protracted deprecation. There is no
fixed rules on how long after a deprecation warning is made to when code
should be removed. In the tidyverse, this process is given ample time in
order to allow the many developers that utilise tidyverse software to
make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>Full descriptions of the {lifecycle} package can be found on the <a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/index.html" class="external-link">pkgdown site</a>,
including the deprecated use of questioning and maturing stages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reconverse">Reconverse<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reconverse"></a>
</h3>
<p>Is similar to {lifecycle} reconverse provides four stages of software
development:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>concept</li>
<li>experimental</li>
<li>maturing</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://github.com/reconverse/reconverse.github.io/blob/a9ecebf28d77e83ad67cf8a645911b667520119f/images/lifecycle_no_text.png"></p>
<p>A difference between {lifecycles} and reconverse is the explicit
connection between semantic versioning and development stage in <a href="https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html" class="external-link">reconverse</a>. The
transitions between experimental, maturing and stable are linked to the
versioning less than 0.1.0, less than 1.0.0 and greater than 1.0.0,
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dynamic-badges">Dynamic badges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dynamic-badges"></a>
</h3>
<p>All badge frameworks discussed only offer static badges that require
developers to manually update as the project moved between phases. This
is subject to the maintainers remembering this, which can lead to
miscommunication about a package which may have move on from being
experimental, or have not been worked on in years but has an active
badge.</p>
<p>Dynamics badges, like those offered by <a href="https://shields.io/" class="external-link uri">https://shields.io/</a> give a good indication of how
recently the project was changed by showing time since last commit, or
the number of commits since last release. These too are not perfect but
may better track changes and take the burden of badge updates off the
project maintainer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="communicating-development-in-the-epiverse-trace">Communicating development in the Epiverse-TRACE<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communicating-development-in-the-epiverse-trace"></a>
</h2>
<p>Within the Epiverse-TRACE initiative we use semantic versioning and
badges to convey to the community interacting with our code at which
stage of developement each project is in. We do not have fixed rules on
which badges to use and a variety of badges can be found across the
repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace" class="external-link">organisation</a>. For example
reconverse badges are used for {linelist}, RepoStatus badge is used in
{finalsize}, and tidyverse badges are used in {epiparameter}.</p>
<p>We take this approach as no lifecycle badging system is perfect, each
with benefits and downsides. The badges from {lifecycle} are the most
common and thus recognisable in R package development, however may not
port well to other languages or be familiar to developers coming to R
from other frameworks. RepoStatus has the benefit of not being designed
for a single language, and it’s number of badges gives greater acuity to
the stage of development for a project. This may be especially useful if
a package is newly developed and {lifecycle} would describe it as
experimental, but RepoStatus provides granularity as to whether it is a
concept package, work in progress (WIP) or started but abandoned.</p>
<p>There is some ambiguity in the semantics of the active stage in
RepoStatus, which in the definition is “stable, usable state”, but may
be misinterpreted as being unstable but actively developed.</p>
<p>Lastly reconverse provides a system akin to {lifecycle} and may be
useful for those working in the epidemiology developer space. However,
one downside of the reconverse system is there are no clear semantics
for a package being deprecated or archived. As with almost all code, at
some point development ceases and this stage should be communicated,
even if just to say that the package is not being updated inline with
developments in the underlying language, in this case R.</p>
<p>There are no plans within Epiverse-TRACE to develop a new badging
system as the existing systems cover almost all use cases. In the event
that the current development stage cannot be adequately communicated
with a single badge from one of the frameworks discussed, a combination
of badges can be used. For example, early on in a project adding both
the experimental badge from {lifecycle} or reconverse and the WIP badge
from RepoStatus may more accurately describe the projects develop pace.
Alternatively, the stable both, from either {lifecycle} or reconverse
can be coupled with either Active or Inactive from RepoStatus to let
other developers know if software will be updated with new language
features or dependency deprecations.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of any of the three lifecycle frameworks described
here is better than none.</p>
